# d3InternetUsageVsUrbanPopulation
A simple scatterplot depicting correlation between urban population and internet usage using world bank data and D3


# Premise
As an objective of learning how to use D3, I have chosen to use worldbank datasets (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/Internet-Usage-vs-Urban-population/id/5bd10722) to plot a graph describing the correlation between Usage of Internet (percentage of population) and Urban Population (percentage of population). The idea behind this choice of dataset was to show that some regions, which are rural and deprived from a proper telecommuncations infrastructure, still manage to have fairly good internet usage rates thanks to relatively high mobile subscription rates.

# Instructions
